# CQRS By Example Book Issues

Our goal is to make "[CQRS By Example](https://leanpub.com/cqrs-by-example)" the best CQRS book for developers. In order to archive that, please, use this repository for reporting [issues, comments, suggestions](https://github.com/cqrs-by-example/book-issues/issues), etc. We'll try to answer all of them and fix asap. Thanks in advance.

We'll include all the contributors in the thanks page. Happy reading!
